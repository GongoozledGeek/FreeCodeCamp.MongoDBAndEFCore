# freeCodeCamp MongoDBAndEFCore Tutorial

An example work through of the freeCodeCamp tutorial for using the new EFCore MongoDb Provider.

Some of the code has been given minor changes to show alternative ways to use. Where this has been done it is highlighted with comments. Model properties have been renamed using the normal EF convention of Pascel Case instead of the tutorial use of Camel Case
